# 30 Days of Solidity


Welcome to the **30 Days of Solidity**! This is a project inspired by [Asabeneh's](https://github.com/Asabeneh) famous "30 Days of Lessons" series, but focused specifically on learning and practicing Solidity.

Solidity is a programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This repository contains a series of 30 lessons that are designed to help you learn Solidity step by step. Each lesson covers a specific topic or concept, and includes code examples, exercises, and additional resources to help you deepen your understanding.

Whether you're new to programming or have some experience, this repository is a great way to learn Solidity and start building your own smart contracts. By the end of the 30 days, you'll have a solid foundation in Solidity and be ready to tackle more advanced topics.

# How to Use This Repository
To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the folder for the day you want to work on. Each day's folder contains a README.md file with instructions and explanations for that day's lesson, as well as any necessary code files or resources.

You can work through the lessons at your own pace, but we recommend completing one lesson per day to stay on track. Each lesson should take approximately 30 minutes to an hour to complete.

If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to open an issue in the repository or reach out to us on social media. We're here to help you succeed!
